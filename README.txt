In my head this seemed like a fun project to take on to help me learn more web development, but the more I type about what I plan to do the more it seems like a monumental task for me, not one to be put off I shall perservere and just keep going until I get it done or my brain melts. Either way this project will definitely help me to understand more, and grow my knowledge

This project is aimed to be a website I create that is connected to a database that I make were I can look at and use to store information about anime shows I have watched, web toons that I have read plus any others I think of as I go

The overall aim for this is to become a project I can show in future when going for work

First I plan to build the HTML pages (Home, About,  Anime, Web toons, Contact me)

Second I will then style all of the pages with the use of CSS, using just standard CSS with flexbox and/or grid,

Third I plan on making a start on some of the javascript funtionality that goes along with the HTML and CSS, i.e for buttons, hover etc

Creation of the databases is next, I'm unsure whether I need more than one database or if I can just create multiple tables in one databse and have the information pulled/edited/updated/deleted from either table from their corresponding section on the website, something i'll think about as I get closer to needing to make it.

The rest I will add whenever I'm close enough to actually doing more than what is shown above.
